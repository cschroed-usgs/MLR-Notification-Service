[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-CIDA/MLR-Notification-Service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-CIDA/MLR-Notification-Service) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/USGS-CIDA/MLR-Notification-Service/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/USGS-CIDA/MLR-Notification-Service?branch=master)


MLR Service to Email Processing Result Notifications to Users

## Running the Application
Copy the application-test.yml file from the project root directory to an "application.yml" file also at the project root directory and change the values as needed.
Open a terminal and cd to the project root directory. Within this directory run 
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/absolute/path/to/your/trust-store.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourtruststoresreadme
``` 
and then the application will launch and be available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. 
The two parameters are needed if the authPublicKeyUrl requires a certificate. The trust store should contain the certificate for that url.

## Profiles
This application has two built-in Spring Profiles to aid with local development.

The **default** profile will enable Authentication. The **swagger** profile will enable the swagger documentation. By
default the project has both profiles. For local development, it may be convenient to specify only **swagger**.
